# Swift Data Structures & Algorithms
This is a repository of Swift Data Structures and Algorithms ranging from Big-O Analysis, Linked Lists, Recursion, Generics and Sorting.

In these examples I used Visual Studio Code and the Integrated Terminal to run the scripts instead of the Xcode Playground. This way these examples can run anywhere Swift runs.

| Section | Item
| ------- | ----
| Big O   | [constant time example](big-oh/constantTime.swift)
| Recursion | [recursively print a linked list](recursion/linkedList.swift)
|  | [recursive factorial function](recursion/factorial.swift)
| Classic Algorithms | [Sum the first n natural numbers](classic-algorithms/sum.swift)
